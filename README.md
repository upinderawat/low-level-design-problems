# low-level-design-problems
Set of basic-intermediate problems encountered in real world scenarios. Solved in Java with Notes for Design Decisions.

► Scheduler Services

These test your ability to manage delayed execution, retries, and time-based workflows reliably.

1. Design a Web Crawler
→ Handle crawl scheduling, politeness policies, and duplication filtering.
→ Talk about scalability via distributed workers and queueing.

2. Design a Distributed Task Scheduler
→ Support retries, job priorities, and delayed execution.
→ Think cron triggers, deduplication, and worker orchestration.

3. Design a Real-Time Notification System
→ Handle push delivery, user targeting, and token lifecycle.
→ Discuss delivery at scale, retries, and cross-device sync.

► Write-Heavy Systems

These test your ability to ingest, process, and store large volumes of data efficiently.

4. Design a Rate Limiter
→ Choose between token bucket and leaky bucket models.
→ Discuss stateless vs stateful limits and distributed implementation using Redis.

5. Design a Log Ingestion System
→ Use Kafka (or similar) for high-throughput collection.
→ Highlight buffering, log processing, and downstream storage solutions.

6. Design a Collaborative Document Editor (Google Docs)
→ Handle real-time updates using CRDTs or OT algorithms.
→ Discuss synchronization, conflict resolution, and concurrent edits.

7. Design a Voting or Polling System
→ Emphasize idempotency and fraud prevention.
→ Handle real-time vs batch aggregation and analytics.

► Strong Consistency Systems

Here, correctness trumps speed — you’re expected to manage transactions, concurrency, and fault tolerance.

8. Design an Online Ticket Booking System
→ Talk about seat reservation and conflict resolution (locks, OCC).
→ Walk through atomic operations between booking and payment.

9. Design an E-Commerce Checkout Flow
→ Handle inventory consistency, cart state, and payment processing.
→ Include order tracking, retries, and failure recovery.

10. Design an Online Messaging App (WhatsApp/Slack)
→ Cover message delivery guarantees and ordering.
→ Dive into message queues, acknowledgements, and offline storage.

11. Design a Task Management Tool (Trello/Asana)
→ Think CRUD APIs, user roles, and real-time collaboration.
→ Discuss background jobs, notifications, and state transitions.

► Read-Heavy Systems

These are all about serving data fast and at scale.

12. Design a URL Shortener (Bitly)
→ Focus on ID generation strategies and how to ensure uniqueness at scale.
→ Discuss read-heavy optimization like caching and eventual consistency.

13. Design a Content Delivery Platform (YouTube/Netflix)
→ Touch on video storage, CDN architecture, and latency reduction.
→ Consider user-specific recommendations and metadata indexing.
14. Design a Social Network Feed (Facebook/Instagram)
→ Dive into fanout strategies and feed generation (Push vs Pull).
→ Talk about timeline ranking, pagination, and denormalized DB design.

15. Design a Product Catalog (eCommerce)
→ Cover search indexing, filters, and faceted navigation.
→ Focus on read-optimized DB design and availability under load.
